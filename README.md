# Advertisement-Click-Through-Rate-prediction

The Internet has become the most prominent and accessible way to 
spread the news about an event or to pitch, advertise and sell a 
product globally. The success of any advertisement campaign lies 
in reaching the right class of target audience and eventually convert 
them as potential customers in the future. Search engines like 
Google, Yahoo are a few of the most used ones by the businesses 
to market their product. The look of the advertisement, 
advertisement position, the age and gender of the audience and the 
size of the advertisement are some of the key factors that are 
available for the businesses to tune. The businesses are 
predominantly charged based on the number of clicks that they 
receive for their advertisement while some websites also bill them 
with a fixed charge per billing cycle. This creates a necessity for 
the advertising platforms to analyse and study these influential 
factors to achieve the maximum possible gain through the 
advertisements. This project presents an advertisement click 
through rate prediction system that analyses several of the factors 
mentioned above to predict if an advertisement will receive a click 
or not. Here we have performed several data wrangling techniques 
in order to clean the data and visualized with respect to the target 
variable to make the data more accessible. We used the ensemble 
models and various classification models with hyperparameter 
tuning and achieved an ROC score of 0.93 and predicted the 
probability for an advertisement to receive a click form the user.
